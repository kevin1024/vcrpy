-  1.1.1 Use function signature preserving ``wrapt.decorator`` to write

   filtering into the ``before_record_callable``.
-  1.1.0 Add ``before_record_response``. Fix several bugs related to the
   context management of cassettes.
-  1.0.3: Fix an issue with requests 2.4 and make sure case sensitivity
   is consistent across python versions
-  1.0.2: Fix an issue with requests 2.3
-  1.0.1: Fix a bug with the new ignore requests feature and the once
   record mode
-  1.0.0: *BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE*: Please see the 'upgrade' section in
   the README. Take a look at the matcher section as well, you might
   want to update your ``match_on`` settings. Add support for filtering
   sensitive data from requests, matching query strings after the order
   changes and improving the built-in matchers, (thanks to @mshytikov),
   support for ignoring requests to certain hosts, bump supported
   Python3 version to 3.4, fix some bugs with Boto support (thanks
   @marusich), fix error with URL field capitalization in README (thanks
   @simon-weber), added some log messages to help with debugging, added
   ``all_played`` property on cassette (thanks @mshytikov)
-  0.7.0: VCR.py now supports Python 3! (thanks @asundg) Also I
   refactored the stub connections quite a bit to add support for the
   putrequest and putheader calls. This version also adds support for
   httplib2 (thanks @nilp0inter). I have added a couple tests for boto
   since it is an http client in its own right. Finally, this version
   includes a fix for a bug where requests wasn't being patched properly
   (thanks @msabramo).
-  0.6.0: Store response headers as a list since a HTTP response can
   have the same header twice (happens with set-cookie sometimes). This
   has the added benefit of preserving the order of headers. Thanks
   @smallcode for the bug report leading to this change. I have made an
   effort to ensure backwards compatibility with the old cassettes'
   header storage mechanism, but if you want to upgrade to the new
   header storage, you should delete your cassettes and re-record them.
   Also this release adds better error messages (thanks @msabramo) and
   adds support for using VCR as a decorator (thanks @smallcode for the
   motivation)
-  0.5.0: Change the ``response_of`` method to ``responses_of`` since
   cassettes can now contain more than one response for a request. Since
   this changes the API, I'm bumping the version. Also includes 2
   bugfixes: a better error message when attempting to overwrite a
   cassette file, and a fix for a bug with requests sessions (thanks
   @msabramo)
-  0.4.0: Change default request recording behavior for multiple
   requests. If you make the same request multiple times to the same
   URL, the response might be different each time (maybe the response
   has a timestamp in it or something), so this will make the same
   request multiple times and save them all. Then, when you are
   replaying the cassette, the responses will be played back in the same
   order in which they were received. If you were making multiple
   requests to the same URL in a cassette before version 0.4.0, you
   might need to regenerate your cassette files. Also, removes support
   for the cassette.play\_count counter API, since individual requests
   aren't unique anymore. A cassette might contain the same request
   several times. Also removes secure overwrite feature since that was
   breaking overwriting files in Windows, and fixes a bug preventing
   request's automatic body decompression from working.
-  0.3.5: Fix compatibility with requests 2.x
-  0.3.4: Bugfix: close file before renaming it. This fixes an issue on
   Windows. Thanks @smallcode for the fix.
-  0.3.3: Bugfix for error message when an unreigstered custom matcher
   was used
-  0.3.2: Fix issue with new config syntax and the ``match_on``
   parameter. Thanks, @chromy!
-  0.3.1: Fix issue causing full paths to be sent on the HTTP request
   line.
-  0.3.0: *Backwards incompatible release* - Added support for record
   modes, and changed the default recording behavior to the "once"
   record mode. Please see the documentation on record modes for more.
   Added support for custom request matching, and changed the default
   request matching behavior to match only on the URL and method. Also,
   improved the httplib mocking to add support for the
   ``HTTPConnection.send()`` method. This means that requests won't
   actually be sent until the response is read, since I need to record
   the entire request in order to match up the appropriate response. I
   don't think this should cause any issues unless you are sending
   requests without ever loading the response (which none of the
   standard httplib wrappers do, as far as I know. Thanks to @fatuhoku
   for some of the ideas and the motivation behind this release.
-  0.2.1: Fixed missing modules in setup.py
-  0.2.0: Added configuration API, which lets you configure some
   settings on VCR (see the README). Also, VCR no longer saves cassettes
   if they haven't changed at all and supports JSON as well as YAML
   (thanks @sirpengi). Added amazing new skeumorphic logo, thanks
   @hairarrow.
-  0.1.0: *backwards incompatible release - delete your old cassette
   files*: This release adds the ability to access the cassette to make
   assertions on it, as well as a major code refactor thanks to
   @dlecocq. It also fixes a couple longstanding bugs with redirects and
   HTTPS. [#3 and #4]
-  0.0.4: If you have libyaml installed, vcrpy will use the c bindings
   instead. Speed up your tests! Thanks @dlecocq
-  0.0.3: Add support for requests 1.2.3. Support for older versions of
   requests dropped (thanks @vitormazzi and @bryanhelmig)
-  0.0.2: Add support for requests / urllib3
-  0.0.1: Initial Release
